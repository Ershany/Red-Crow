# Blitz SMS - COMP 3004 Project

Blitz SMS is an Android App in Development.

Blitz SMS will allow users to browse the web, without using their data plan. It uses SMS to communicate with our server, and our server will perform web scrapping in order to give the user the information that they want. We will be supporting searches, web pages, news feeds, and maps.
